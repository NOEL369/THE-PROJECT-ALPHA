# THE-PROJECT-ANRO-ALPHA
This project focuses on developing a virtually
controlled robot by integrating Virtual Reality (VR) and Robot
Operating System (ROS). Robots can be used in certain
environments where humans cannot be physically present to
undertake a task. To increase the safety of humans, controlling
a robot virtually is one of the best solutions. This project shows
how the VR-controlled manipulator will help in different fields
like hazardous environments, underwater research, and the
medical field for surgical operations. Unity 3D is used to develop
the virtual environment, and ROS is used for communication
with the physical robot. A Virtual environment would be
developed where an exact robot (URDF) model can be designed.
The interaction with the virtual environment is done with the
help of VR headsets and controllers. ROS acts as the
communication bridge between virtual and physical robots. A
prototype has been developed to be controlled through virtual
controllers that can interact through ROS.
